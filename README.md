1. Four functions<br>
 <p>- getUpdates
    - rebuildUpdates
      - registerDLL
        - regServer3</p>

3. Yes you could write this as one large script, however, when putting this together I had all of these pieces in other scripts so development time was minor. 
4. This was an answer to a question.
