# Universal Windows Update. 

1. Four functions<br><br>
 <p>- getUpdates<br>
    - rebuildUpdates<br>
      - registerDLL<br>
        - regServer3</p><br><br>
2. Each function handles an increasingly smaller portion of the overall script. <br><br>
3. Yes you could write this as one large script, however, when putting this together I had all of these pieces in other scripts so development time was minor. <br><br>
4. This was an answer to a question.
